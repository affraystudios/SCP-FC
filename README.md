# SCP - Foundation Command Codebase
This isn't a production-ready codebase as it stands, but it should serve as a basic example on how to do a game like this. 

For now, we will not be providing any documentation. We hope to change this in the near-future. We also plan on opening up changes to be made to this repo by the community.
